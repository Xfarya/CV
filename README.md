Anthropologist turned to tech! Worked worldwide in NGOs and Development. Highly motivated to taking on challenges, believing that I am capable of learning anything I put my mind to. Particularly love problem solving and working in dynamic teams.

My background in development has equipped me with resilience, a strong work ethic, and a strong sense of empathy. I am excited by all aspects of tech, especially in how it can be a force of positive change in how people relate to each other, and can move us towards more equitable and empowered societies!

<!-- After graduation I worked in several places (France, Greece, Iraq and Egypt), in various roles within international development agencies. Between then and now, I have studied Arabic at the French Institute in Cairo, trained at a Muay Thai camp, worked as a project manager on some local construction projects, started teaching myself how to code, and received two scholarships (Makers and Kernel) to learn more about tech, coding, and web3! -->

<!-- Since June 2021, I have been studying with a full scholarship at Makers Academy, a developer bootcamp. Intensive, the course has given me fundamentals of software development through making interesting projects. I have also been learning best coding practices. I am excited to be in a dynamic and creative working environment! -->

## Skills

<!--
-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.
 -->

Communicator

Working for SMART news as the only native English speaker in an Arabic newspaper was a position purely based on the importance of effective communication. I had to constantly make sure my manager was able to understand the decisions I was taking, as he only spoke Arabic. I did this through sending regular e-mail updates, requesting other colleagues to mediate our conversations, and sending translated versions of the texts. This ensured that our work thrived, despite the barriers of distance (working remotely) and language.

Thrive under pressure

Being able to communicate and mediate has been a big part of most of my previous jobs. As a cultural mediator with Save the Children, it was my job to make sure the beneficiaries were receiving all the information pertinent to their needs at the shelter. I wrote up and translated copies to be distributed around the shelter, and headed any staff meetings or interactions that involved communication with the beneficiaries. I was also the first point of call for emergencies.

Initiative

When I started working for Bihar in Iraq as a Sr Monitoring and Evaluation Officer, I was thrown into the deep-end having to learn everything from scratch and train my team from day one. I did as much research as I could on the position, and produced studies and analyses of the local area, learning about data collection techniques. I also networked by attending all the local conferences to do with the topics of our concern (protection, health clusters), looking for potential project partners and donors.

Analytical
I worked as a researcher for Law Business Research, which required me to produce reports on economic trends in corporate law markets. I headed the constuction law issue, being respoisble to delegating research to my team, producing and editing articles and reports, carrying out primary and secondary research. I enjoy analytical thinking and I was glad readers benefitted from my research and predictions on seasonal legal market fluctuations.
